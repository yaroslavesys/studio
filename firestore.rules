/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AccessFlow application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model combined with role-based access control.
 * User documents and their related data (e.g., access requests) are primarily accessible only to the owning user.
 * Access to Roles and Departments is public for `get` and `list` operations, as these are considered lookup tables.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.  `userId` MUST match the Firebase auth `uid`.
 * - /roles/{roleId}: Stores role definitions. Publicly readable.
 * - /departments/{departmentId}: Stores department definitions. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/accessRequests/{accessRequestId}: Stores access requests created by a user. `userId` in the path MUST match the `userId` field in the document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Roles and Departments are publicly readable to allow for UI rendering of dropdowns.
 * - Authorization relies solely on `request.auth.uid` and document ownership; custom claims are not used.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - AccessRequest documents should ideally include a denormalized `departmentId` (copied from the user's profile) to enable department-level access rules if needed in the future.
