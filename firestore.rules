/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AccessFlow application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their access requests,
 * combined with role-based access control for roles and departments.
 * User documents can only be created by themselves. Access Requests are nested under users and
 * follow the same ownership pattern.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /roles/{roleId}: Stores role definitions.
 * - /departments/{departmentId}: Stores department definitions.
 * - /users/{userId}/accessRequests/{accessRequestId}: Stores access requests for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user documents.
 * - Access requests are owned by the user who created them and can only be managed by them.
 * - Listing of all users, roles, and departments is disallowed to prevent information disclosure.
 * - Role and Department documents are globally readable. Write operations are denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `User` document denormalizes `roleId` and `departmentId` to simplify authorization checks
 * and avoid costly `get()` calls.
 * This allows rules to directly check `resource.data.roleId` against allowed roles.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Roles and departments are stored in separate top-level collections, allowing for
 * efficient management and querying of these entities.
